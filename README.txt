'generate-pointcloud' is a script that requires some specific inputs...

First of all, it needs to be fed a tree definition (XML) generated in Arbaro.

It also needs a sensor definition.  The way this is defined is by a binary file
which lists a set of lines generated by the LiDAR sensor at any one point in the
trajectory of the sensor.  For instance, the Zeb1 sensor scans across 270
degrees at a 0.625 degree interval, with a maximum distance (outside) of 15m.
The "low-quality" fake sensor has a 1 degree interval and a maximum distance of 8m.
The line length in this sensor definition is important, as is the orientation
of the sensor plane.

The last thing that's needed is a sensor trajectory - how the sensor will move
around the generated stand of trees to generate the point cloud.
For instance, the Zeb1 sensor is bounced around in a circle around the tree.
The LiDAR on Shrimp spins continuously while travelling in straight lines.
These trajectories need to be defined in a specific global reference frame,
and rotation must be defined by quaternion.  The reference frame used currently
derives from the definition provided by GeoSLAM in the Zebedee output files.
