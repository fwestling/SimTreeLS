# V-LiDAR: A system for generating virtual LiDAR data

## Installation:

This library depends on  [Comma](https://github.com/acfr/comma) and [Snark](https://github.com/acfr/snark) (by ACFR).

We include Arbaro for tree generation, presented [here](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps124/spring08/assign/07_papers/p119-weber.pdf) and licensed under GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2).

Included in the directory is an install.sh script which should install all dependencies correctly on a clean install of Ubuntu.  As of September 2019, this works on Ubuntu 20.04 running as a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2, but the ACFR libraries are quite old, so may be subject to breaking changes.

If you are running WSL, make sure to set up X display forwarding or graphics won't work.

## Usage: 

### generate-pointcloud:
`generate-pointcloud` is the main entry point function; it takes in some parameters and generates a point cloud by simulating a LiDAR trajectory.

`generate-pointcloud` is a script that requires some specific inputs...

First of all, it needs to be fed a tree definition (XML) generated in Arbaro.

It also needs a sensor definition. The way this is defined is by a binary file
which lists a set of lines generated by the LiDAR sensor at any one point in the
trajectory of the sensor. For instance, the Zeb1 sensor scans across 270
degrees at a 0.625 degree interval, with a maximum distance (outside) of 15m.
The "low-quality" fake sensor has a 1 degree interval and a maximum distance of 8m.
The line length in this sensor definition is important, as is the orientation
of the sensor plane.

The last thing that's needed is a sensor trajectory - how the sensor will move
around the generated stand of trees to generate the point cloud.
For instance, the Zeb1 sensor is bounced around in a circle around the tree.
The LiDAR on Shrimp spins continuously while travelling in straight lines.
These trajectories need to be defined in a specific global reference frame,
and rotation must be defined by quaternion. The reference frame used currently
derives from the definition provided by GeoSLAM in the Zebedee output files.
